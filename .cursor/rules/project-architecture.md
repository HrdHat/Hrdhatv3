## üìÅ Folder Responsibilities

| Folder       | Purpose                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `assets/`    | Static files (images, icons, fonts)                      |
| `components/`| Visual building blocks (e.g., Button, Input). No logic. |
| `config/`    | Static configuration (env, tokens, constants). No imports allowed. |
| `db/`        | Direct Supabase queries only. No app logic here.        |
| `guards/`    | Route guards and auth wrappers.                         |
| `layout/`    | AppShell, Sidebar, content wrappers. No form logic.     |
| `modules/`   | Business logic + scoped services (e.g., FLRA module).   |
| `pages/`     | Route entry points. No logic here.                      |
| `services/`  | App-wide logic: auth, pdf, sync. May use db + utils.    |
| `session/`   | Memory/localStorage/session state handlers              |
| `styles/`    | Global ITCSS styles only                                |
| `util/`      | Pure functions with zero side effects. No network, no DOM. |
