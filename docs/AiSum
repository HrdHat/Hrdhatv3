@AiSum â€” Progress Recap

Where We Left Off:
- Dynamic FLRA form architecture is scaffolded and committed.
- Sidebar uses logic-driven buttons and a reusable confirmation dialog.
- All form state, module preferences, and auto-save logic are now robust, modular, and ready for dynamic rendering.
- All code and empty folders are included in the new branch: feature/dynamic-flra-architecture

Where We'll Continue:
- Integrate the new useFlraFormData hook and services into the FLRA form builder UI.
- Wire up the "Create New FLRA" button to actually create a new form in Supabase and navigate to it.
- Implement dynamic module rendering based on user preferences.
- Add error and save status feedback to the UI.
- (Optional) Add a "Reset" button for destructive clearing, if desired.
- Expand the pattern to other forms and modules as needed.

You can now open a pull request or continue development on this branch!
