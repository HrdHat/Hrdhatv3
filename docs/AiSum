@AiSum â€” Progress Recap

Where We Left Off:
- Dynamic FLRA schema (with company/project support, versioning, and JSONB for flexible modules) is now live and successfully migrated.
- All tables created in correct dependency order; schema is ready for dynamic, company/project-specific forms and modules.
- Legacy tables remain for reference; new forms should use the new dynamic structure.

Where We'll Continue:
- Build new services to create forms, modules, and fields using the new schema.
- Integrate the new useFlraFormData hook and services into the FLRA form builder UI.
- Wire up the "Create New FLRA" button to actually create a new form in Supabase and navigate to it.
- Implement dynamic module rendering based on user preferences and form structure.
- Add error and save status feedback to the UI.
- (Optional) Add a "Reset" button for destructive clearing, if desired.
- Expand the pattern to other forms and modules as needed.

You can now open a pull request or continue development on this branch with the new schema!
